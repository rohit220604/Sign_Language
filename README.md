# Sign Language Detection

# Project Overview

This project is focused on detecting and recognizing sign language gestures using a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing, Mediapipe for hand tracking, and TensorFlow/Keras for gesture classification. The ultimate goal is to facilitate communication by accurately translating sign language into text.

## Technologies and Tools

1. Programming Languages - 
Python: The main programming language used for developing and implementing the detection and classification algorithms.

2. Computer Vision - OpenCV: Used for real-time image and video processing, including capturing video frames and performing necessary transformations on the data.

3. Machine Learning -

    TensorFlow/Keras: Utilized for creating and training the neural network model used to classify hand gestures into specific sign language symbols.

   Mediapipe: A machine learning framework used for hand landmark detection and tracking, which helps in accurately identifying the position and movement of hands.

4. Libraries:

   NumPy: Employed for efficient numerical computations and data manipulation.

   Scikit-learn: Used for splitting data into training and testing sets, and possibly for evaluating the performance of the model.

   ImageDataGenerator: A Keras utility that aids in augmenting image data, which is crucial for increasing the robustness of the model.

## How It Works

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Video frames or images are captured and preprocessed using OpenCV to standardize the input size and format.
Hand landmarks are detected and tracked using Mediapipe, which helps in isolating the hand gestures.
2. Model Training: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained using TensorFlow/Keras to classify the preprocessed hand gesture images into specific sign language symbols.
Data augmentation techniques are applied using ImageDataGenerator to increase the variety and robustness of the training data.
3. Gesture Recognition: Once trained, the model is used to recognize hand gestures in real-time. The recognized gestures are translated into corresponding sign language symbols or text.
4. Real-Time Application: The system captures video input, processes each frame, and provides real-time predictions of the sign language gestures being performed.

## Future Work

1. Expand the Dataset: Collect more diverse hand gesture images to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.

2. Optimize the Model: Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to enhance performance.

3. Deploy the System: Create a user-friendly interface and deploy the model for practical use in applications or devices.
